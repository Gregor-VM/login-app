# Description

I started this project for do something simple with firebase using autentication but I did an articles app which also use firestore for save data and and an API called cloudinary for save image. Using this app you can add articles, edit, delete using an your own account which you can create with email or gmail, is addition you can change your information on the aplication or delete your account including all the articles that you had been created.
